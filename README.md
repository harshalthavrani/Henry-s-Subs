# Henrys-Subs

Developed a server-side web application for a restaurant using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express and EJS as a part of an assignment. 

Collected all user details to deliver the purchased subs and generated an invoice using HTML5. Created an external Javascript file where the user detail fields were made mandatory and payment information was validated using Regex pattern. Displayed all errors as labels using Javascript. 

Calculated sales tax for each province/territory in Canada. Also calculated shipping cost based on delivery time selected by the user.
